# rem-my-park-yo

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/hijha/rem-my-park-yo)

A Yo app that remembers where you parked the car and sends you the reminder before your time expires, along with the location of your car.

The way this works is.. on Yo, you will be able to find my app by the name RemMyParkYo (should be all CAPS). 
I have yet to register an official server for it. Will update this when I do.

In the meanwhile, if you want to use the code to create your own server and deploy the app, you can simply clone this project and get your API KEY from http://yoapi.justyo.co

Have fun Yo-ing. :)



I am new with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB and Yo (so, pretty much everything that has been used in this app).
