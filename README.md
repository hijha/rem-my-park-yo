# rem-my-park-yo

A Yo app that remembers where you parked the car and sends you the reminder before your time expires, along with the location of your car.


Background::
I worked on this project at McHacks (McGill University Hackathon). When I started, I had no experience with Express.js, MongoDB or Yo API. I only had a basic idea about Node.js. So, this was not only a hackathon project, but a learning project too. 
The next apps using MEAN stack (mean.io) will definitely be an improvement on this one.
